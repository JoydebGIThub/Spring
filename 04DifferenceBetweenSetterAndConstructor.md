## Constructor Injection VS Setter injection in Spring Core:
Constructor injection and setter injection are two primary methods of implementing dependency injection in Spring Core. Each approach has its advantages and use cases, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application.

### comparison between constructor injection and setter injection in Spring Core:
#### Constructor Injection:
`Usage`: In constructor injection, dependencies are provided to a class through its constructor. You declare the required dependencies as parameters in the constructor.

#### Advantages:
- Ensures that all **required** dependencies are provided at the `time of object creation`, making the object ready for use immediately after instantiation.
- Guarantees that the class will be in a `valid state` once `instantiated`, as all required dependencies are initialized.
- Makes dependencies `immutable after object creation`, promoting thread safety and immutability.
- Provides clear visibility of dependencies at the class level

#### Setter Injection:
`Usage`: In setter injection, dependencies are provided to a class through setter methods. You declare setter methods for each dependency, and Spring `sets the dependencies` using these methods `after object creation`.

#### Advantages:
- Allows for **optional** dependencies, as not all setter need to be invoked. This can be useful when dealing with dependencies that are not essential for the object's operation.
- Facilitates easier testing and mock injection, as dependencies can be replaced or mocked using setters.
- Supports gradual initialization of dependencies, where not all dependencies need to be provided at once.

### Conclusion: 
In general, it's recommended to use constructor injection by default, as it provides better encapsulation, immutability, and ensures that dependencies are satisfied upon object creation. However, setter injection can be useful in specific scenarios where optional or dynamic dependencies are required. Both approaches are supported by Spring Core, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate method based on the requirements of their application.
